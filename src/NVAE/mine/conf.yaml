autoencoder:
  num_scales: 3 # the number of downsamples in encoder tower (latent scales)
  num_groups_per_scale: 2 # number of groups (latent variables) per scale
  is_adaptive: false # Settings this to true will set different number of groups per scale (starting by num groups per scale and div by 2, up to min groups_per_scale)
  min_groups_per_scale: 1 # the minimum number of groups per scale.
  num_cells_per_group: 1 # number of cell for each conditional in encoder
  num_latent_per_group: 32 # number of channels in group latent variables
  num_nf_cells: # not implemented yet
  initial_channels: 32 # number of initial channels in encoder
  num_pre-post_process_blocks: 1 # number of pre/post processing blocks (each one down/up scales image)
